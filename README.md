**Sae** is experimental gallery module for [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) that sparks joy. This module works and being installed as WordPress plugin.

## Sae? Wat?
`Sae` is sundanese language for `good` in polite form (Sundanese language has different word for different level of formality and politeness).

I just need a decent and _unique_ name for this project, and i happen to be sundanese, so that's it.

## Experimental?
I made this plugin to do ~fancy~ exciting stuff on [my personal blog](http://fikrirasyid.com) which i posted tons of photos. Hence this plugin is totally personal and subjective.

DISCLAIMER: I work at Elegant Themes and I think it is good idea to explore and test our stuff in real world setting. However what i do and experiment in this plugin is my personal view and doesn't reflect the view of my employer.

## Sparks Joy? Huh?
The plugin is opiniated and subjective: i simply try to cater my own needs so i keep the scope limited so i can focus on doing things on this plugin that makes me happy and not reasonably doing anything that isn't really interest me.

ie: I don't plan to make this plugin to support IE or legacy browser. They don't spark joy.

## Gallery module?
Yeah, at least for now. The plugin is right now is on its pre v1 phase. What i aim on this phase is:

### v0.x
- It is sort of MVP phase. I just want to make it work and use it on my blog
- The plugin has Gallery module (with slider module-like structure) on Divi
- The gallery has two layouts: CSS-column powered Masonry layout and Plain list of image layout
- :wat:... CSS-column for gallery masonry layout? Told ya this is experimental
